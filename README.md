# what is Flutter

Flutter is an open source framework developed by Google to create high quality, high performance
mobile applications across mobile operating systems - Android and iOS. It provides a simple,
powerful, efficient and easy to understand SDK to write mobile applications in Googleâ€™s own
language, Dart.
With Flutter, we can write the app's code once and deploy it on multiple platforms(Android, IOS,
Desktop). Due to its flexibility and performance capabilities, Flutter is the top pick for modern app
development across various platforms.
In general, developing a mobile application is a complex and challenging task. There are many
frameworks available to develop a mobile application. Android provides a native framework based
on Java language and iOS provides a native framework based on Objective-C / Swift language.
However, to develop an application supporting both the OSs, we need to code in two different
languages using two different frameworks. To help overcome this complexity, there exists mobile
frameworks supporting both OS. These frameworks range from simple HTML based hybrid
mobile application framework (which uses HTML for User Interface and JavaScript for application
logic) to complex language specific framework (which do the heavy lifting of converting code to
native code). Irrespective of their simplicity or complexity, these frameworks always have many
disadvantages, one of the main drawback being their slow performance.
